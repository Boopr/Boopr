                                Born and raised in South San Antonio, I am web developer with a passion for automation and connecting different tech to other interests and hobbies. I took a coding bootcamp to accelerate and learn industry standards for developing web applications. 
                                I have been interested in computers since childhood. From hosting online gaming servers for different communities to now creating online web applications. Looking forward to a career where I can leverage my skills to build a bridge between technology and people to create programs that meet the needs of the end-user.

                                Hello! I would like to thank you for visiting our site! I am an Air Force veteran who has transitioned from management in the fitness industry to working in web development. I believe that technology and web development give us the opportunity to turn the theoretical into practical applications that affect our daily lives. 
                                I was inspired to create Boopr by realizing that while we as people love content of our pets, there currently does not exist a platform solely dedicated to showcasing our furry friends. My hope is for Boopr to continue to grow and evovle into an application that allows pet owners to come together in an inclusive environment 
                                and celebrate our furry friends while also creating a positive and uplifting web experience.

                    This project can be found on github with instructions on deployment <a href="https://github.com/Boopr/Boopr">here</a>. This project was the result of our final capstone project worked on at Codeup, a coding bootcamp for Full-Stack Java Web Development. The goal was to have a responsive website using rest controllers and AJAX. A lot of this website has custom built javascript classes and modules to generate a lot of the UI. Most of it allowed us to have quick control on editing reduntent commands for creating elements and dealing with events.
                </div>

                <h4 class="my-4">The Future</h4>

                <div class="my-2 fs-5">
                    Going forward with this project, we aim to use Vue.JS with VueX and seperate the frontend from the backend. This will allow the app to be more flexable with our goals of making an Android app in the coming time since Java is currently under our belts now. We will also implement JWT for security to make the api easier to use for other frontends.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    New features to add and lots more are in store that will make this more exciting and cool place to post your cute dog photos. Stay tuned to the project as there is more to come!
